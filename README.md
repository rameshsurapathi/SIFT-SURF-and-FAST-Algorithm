SIFT-SURF-and-FAST-Algorithm
============================

This project is a comparative study of different Image tampering detection algorithms. The comparative studies assess the performance of the algorithms based on the results obtained in different criteria such as number of feature points, feature descriptors and others. These studies are an important resource to understand the behavior of the algorithms and their influence on the results obtained. Mainly we are concentrating on algorithms SIFT, SURF and FAST.
